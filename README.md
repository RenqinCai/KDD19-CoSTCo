# KDD19-CoSTCo

Demo run for KDD2019 paper "CoSTCo: A Neural Tensor Completion Model for Sparse Tensors".


## Requirements
We run experiments with following package versions with Python2.

```
tensorflow==1.14.0
keras==2.2.4
```

## Run the demo

### Run in the Google's colab (no need to install any packages)

1. Open this [colab link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/USC-Melady/KDD19-CoSTCo/blob/master/costco_demo.ipynb).
2. Choose property runtime: Click "Runtime" -> "Change Runtime Type" -> "python=2, hardware accelerator=GPU"
3. Run all: Click "Runtime" -> "Run all"

### Run in a local machine

1. git clone this repo
2. (optional) set up virtualenv
